   <h3>What is Web Development ?</h3>
   <p>So, you’re interested in becoming a developer? Congratulations, and welcome to your new career! As you’ve
    started looking into different developer career paths, you’ve probably come across web development.</p>
    <p>But what is web development exactly? Why is it important, and what kinds of Web Developers are there?</p>
    <p>In a few words, web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites.
     By “website,” we mean a collection of web pages that are publicly accessible on the internet.</p>
     <p>Modern web development also includes web applications. Web applications are software packages that run on a web server and are accessed through the internet.
     This is unlike a traditional application that runs on your computer, tablet, or phone.</p>
     <h2>Front-end vs. back-end web development</h2>
     <p>Even if you’re new to web development, you’ve probably heard the terms “front-end development” and “back-end development” before. But what do they mean?
     Front-end web development has to do with the interface that you, the user, interact with when you visit a website or use a web application. 
     Front-End Developers create everything you see on a web page, including:</p>
     <ul>
    <li>Colors</li>
    <li>Layout</li>
    <li>Navigation</li>
     </ul>
     <p>Back-end web development has to do with the parts of a 
        website that you can’t see, particularly how website information is stored and retrieved.</p>
    <p>When you access a webpage in your browser, you’re essentially requesting to see a file stored on a server 
    somewhere. When you load a webpage for the first time or sign into a website with a username and password, it’s Back-End Developers who make it possible to access website information efficiently and securely.
    </p>
    <h2>The web development process</h2>
    <p>Suppose that a new client needs a new website and has
         asked you to develop one. Where do you start, and what do you do next?</p>
         <p>Whether you’re creating a website or web application with a team of three
             or 300, web development tends to follow the same seven steps.</p>
             <h5>Information gathering</h5>
             <p>Information gathering includes addressing internal factors (like the website’s purpose) 
                and external factors (like information about the target audience and competing websites).</p>
            <p>Questions you’ll need to answer during this stage include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Why is the client creating a website?</li>
            <li>Who do they want to visit the site?</li>
            <li>What will people be able to do on the website or in the web application?</li>
            <li>Why will people want to use the client’s website instead of someone else’s?</li>
          </ul>
    <h5>Planning</h5>
    <p>Once you understand the purpose of your website and what kind of people you want to visit, it’s time to start planning. During this stage, 
        dev teams put together an outline of the website and its web pages. This is known as a sitemap.

        Think of the sitemap as the skeleton of the website. Web Developers use sitemaps to flesh out how webpages will 
        link to each other through menus and how website data should be structured on the webserver.</p>
    <h5>Design</h5>
    <p>In the design phase, the dev team begins to create something like an actual website. Layouts, images, logos,
         colors, fonts, and other aesthetic features are put together and visualized during this phase. The client may provide an existing logo and color scheme or be open to designs your team presents.

        Next, you and the client will agree on a layout, information structure, 
        and aesthetic direction to guide the rest of the web development project.</p>
        <h5>Content creation</h5>
    <p>Until now, the web development team will have put in placeholder images and text in the website design until the real content is ready to be inserted
         Typically, it’s up to the client to provide the content. And because content creation can be done throughout the rest of the web development process, the content should be ready as soon as the design phase is finished.
        At this point, the web development team may work with the client to adjust word counts and character limits for menus and ensure that image and video files look full size.</p>
        <h5>Coding</h5>
        <p>Once the website design and content are finalized, it’s time to start coding. At this point, both Front-End Developers and Back-End Developers will work to turn the website design on paper into a working reality that functions within a browser.
       The coding process itself depends on the size of the project and the design approach of the development team. For example, a small project for an informational website might involve just a couple of programmers working together.
             A large-scale web application might involve teams of developers adopting an Agile approach like Scrum.</p>
        <h5>Testing and launch</h5>
        <p>Just like with software, websites need to be tested and debugged before they’re ready to go live. That means developing test cases and ensuring that the website code follows the client’s QA/QC procedures.
             Web development testing might include checking all hyperlinks, searching for typos, and ensuring that the website works well on different browsers and devices.
            Finally, the website is ready to be uploaded to the webserver and accessed publicly on the internet.</p>
            <h5>Maintenance</h5>
            <p>After the website is up and running, it still needs to be maintained. Websites need to be updated for dozens of reasons — team member bios are added and removed, product and service descriptions change, and blog posts are published.
              On the back end, a website or web application that stores 
                customer data will need to ensure that databases are secure and comply with the latest data privacy regulations.</p>

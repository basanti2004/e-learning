   <h3>JavaScript</h3>
   <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
   <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
   <h5>Client-side: </h5>
   <p>It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.</p>
   <h5>Server-side:</h5>
   <p>It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.</p>
   <h5>Imperative language :</h5>
    <p>In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It simply control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call.</p>
    <h5>Declarative programming :</h5>   
    <p> In this type of language we are concern about how it is to be done , basically here logical computation require . Here  main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it like  arrow function do .</p>
    <h2>JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:</h2>
    <h5>Internal JS:</h5>
   <p> We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the script tag. The script tag can either be placed inside the head or the body tag according to the requirement.</p>
    <h5>External JS: </h5>
    <p>We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension.js and then link this file inside the <head> tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.
    </p>
 <h2>History of JavaScript:</h2>
 <p> It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser. </p>
  <h2>Why JavaScript is known as a lightweight programming language?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript is considered as lightweight due to the fact that it has low CPU usage, is easy to implement and has a minimalist syntax. Minimalist syntax as in, it has no data types. Everything is treated here as an object. It is very easy to learn because of its syntax similar to C++ and Java.</p>
  <p>A lightweight language does not consume much of your CPU’s resources. It doesn’t put excess strain on your CPU or RAM. JavaScript runs in the browser even though it has complex paradigms and logic which means it uses fewer resources than other languages. For example, NodeJs, a variation of JavaScript not only performs faster computations but also uses less resources than its counterparts such as Dart or Java.</p>
   <h2>What makes JavaScript unique?</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Full integration with HTML/CSS.</li>
    <li>Simple things are done simply.</li>
    <li>Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.

    That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.
    
    That said, JavaScript can be used to create servers, mobile applications, etc.</p>
